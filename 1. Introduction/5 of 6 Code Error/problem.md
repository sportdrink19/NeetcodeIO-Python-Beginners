## Code Errors

Earlier if you attempted to run
```python
print("My favorite quote is "To be or not to be."")
```
You may have seen something like this in the console

```
ERROR!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<main.py>", line 1
    print("My favorite quote is "To be or not to be."")
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?
```

This is the result of an error in our code. Specifically, it's a syntax error. ```Syntax``` errors occur when the code is not written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. It's not so different from a spelling or grammar error in a human language, except that computers are much less forgiving.

Sometimes you may get helpful error messages which help you identify the problem. Other times, the error message may not be as clear.

There are many types of programming errors such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. Syntax errors are easier to fix, because they usually point out which line the error is on.

## Challenge

Correct the code so that it prints out
```
Can someone pls add a closing parenthesis?
```
Starting code
```python
print("Can someone pls add a closing parenthesis?"
