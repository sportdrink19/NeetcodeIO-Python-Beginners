## Execution Order
In programming, code is generally executed line-by-line, from top to bottom, and this holds true for Python code as well. This means that the order in which you write your code is important.

For example, the following code:
```python
print("First")
print("Second")
print("Third")
```
will output:
```
First
Second
Third
```
## Challenge
In the code editor, there are three print statements. Rearrange them so that the output is:
```
Fourth
Fifth
Sixth
```

## Starting Code
```
print("Fifth")
print("Fourth")
print("Sixth")
```
